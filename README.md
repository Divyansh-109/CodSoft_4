# CodSoft_4
One more project(task) from CodSoft as a part of internship.

A Rock-Paper-Scissors Game which will be played between user and computer, the logic of game will be same as real one. It is an enjoyful project for me as it helped me to learn coding by building some game, and using logics to make it perfect.

It includes all basic concepts of Python, with random module and user friendly interface.
